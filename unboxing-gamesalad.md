# Unboxing GameSalad

## What is it?
GameSalad is a game-development platform for OS X and Windows aimed at younger and inexperienced developers. It features an innovative drag-and-drop interface allowing even the newest of developers or those with no previous coding experience to make games for iOS, Android and even HTML5 applications that can run in a browser.

## Use in education
GameSalad is used in education by Box UK and by schools across Wales and the rest of the UK. It's intutative interface allows children to quickly and easily learn the concepts behind object-orientated programming such as objects, classes and control flow. But it stops shorts of expecting children to write code. Box UK is using GameSalad as part of the Technocamps projects to develop a learning application with children to be deployed in schools throughout Wales.

## Getting to grips
As an iOS developer more used to working with applications at a code level, I initially found working with GameSalad a confusing experience. It encourages a totally new way of thinking about application development which doesn't support object-orientation in a way I've become accustomed to in most modern languages. Apart from to create other objects, there is virtually no support to alter the attributes of objects other than `self`.
